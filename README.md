## Project Source Codes:
* [The Hangman Game](https://github.com/angelchen1030/stanCode_SC101_projects/tree/main/stanCode_SC101_projects/The%20Hangman%20Game)
  * This program plays a hangman game, using while loop, if statement, input function, and Python strings; users see a dashed word and attempt to correctly decipher the un-dashed word by inputting one character each round; if the user input is correct, the updated word is shown on the console
  
* [Whack-A-Mole Game](https://github.com/angelchen1030/stanCode_SC101_projects/tree/main/stanCode_SC101_projects/Whack-A-Mole%20Game)
  * This program plays a game called "Whack-a-Mole" in which players clicking the popping moles on the screen to gain scores 

* [The Breakout Game](https://github.com/angelchen1030/stanCode_SC101_projects/tree/main/stanCode_SC101_projects/The%20Breakout%20Game)
  * The aim is to recreate a game of Breakout, using OOP, Private and Public Variables, and Multiple Inheritance to break bricks of a brick wall by having the ball hit/bounce on the bricks; the score corresponds to the number of bricks being hit
  
* [stanCodoshop](https://github.com/angelchen1030/stanCode_SC101_projects/tree/main/stanCode_SC101_projects/stanCodoshop)
  * The aim is to use Python List to loop every pixel of photos and remove people from travel photos
  
* [Presenting Baby Names of USA](https://github.com/angelchen1030/stanCode_SC101_projects/tree/main/stanCode_SC101_projects/Presenting%20Baby%20Names%20of%20USA)
  * The aim is to use Python Dictionary to process the frequency of baby names in the United States from 1900 to 2010; the Tkinter package (“Tk interface”) is then used to create the GUI applications

* [Anagram Solver](https://github.com/angelchen1030/stanCode_SC101_projects/tree/main/stanCode_SC101_projects/Anagram%20Solver)
  * The aim is to create an anagram solver using two graph traversal algorithms: Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS) to find name anagrams or phrases using multiple words
  
* [Boggle Game](https://github.com/angelchen1030/stanCode_SC101_projects/tree/main/stanCode_SC101_projects/Boggle%20Game)
  * The aim is to create a Python program that plays Boggle using two graph traversal algorithms: Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS) to find phrases using multiple words

* [Halfman Encoding](https://github.com/angelchen1030/stanCode_SC101_projects/tree/main/stanCode_SC101_projects/Halfman%20Encoding)
  * The aim is to build a Huffman Tree to compress, encode, and decode data using recursion, Tree, LinkedList, Priority Queue, and Class
